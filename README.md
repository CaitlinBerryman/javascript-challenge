Exercise in filtering data based on various inputs.

All criteria achieved. For both levels, an additional "remove filters" button is added to restore table to default listing of all values.

## Level 1

Load in all rows of data initially. From there, enter a date and filter to show only events occurring on that date.

Extra functionality: if input box remains empty, filter event will not happen (avoids showing nothing).

## Level 2

Builds on Level 1, except to filter by multiple categories (Date, City, State, Country, Shape).

Extra functionality from above is necessary to run properly, rather than an added bonus; otherwise, an empty input in any part of the form will return an empty table.
